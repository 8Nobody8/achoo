""		
This is a summary variable provided for trending with previous years of data, although the format has		
changed slightly from previous years to better reflect uncertainties and nuances in the injury data. It has		
been recoded from the INJPOISAD variable below.		
""		
This item reflects a broad definition of injury traditionally used in NAMCS, but some changes have been		
made in 2016.  It includes visits with any of the following: NCHS Reason for Visit Classification codes in		
the injury, poisoning, or adverse effects module (50000-59999), diagnosis codes in the ‘S’ or ‘T’ chapters		
of ICD-10-CM, diagnosis codes for complications of medical or surgical care (located throughout the ICD-		
10-CM; a list of codes is available by contacting AHCSB); and cause of injury codes in the ‘V’, ‘W’, ‘X’ and		
"‘Y’ chapters of ICD-10-CM.  This definition of injury is used in the INJURY, INJPOISAD, and INTENT15"		
variables.  It is somewhat narrower than the broad definition used in NAMCS data in the past.  The older		
definition included other conditions, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, which were outside of the Injury and		
Poisoning chapter of ICD-9-CM.

""		OVERDOSE/POISONING OR ADVERSE EFFECT OF MEDICAL/
""		SURGICAL TREATMENT?
""		
""		This variable reflects the injury item format used since 2012.
""		INJPOISAD was created directly from reason for visit, diagnosis, and
""		cause of injury codes first, followed by consideration of unedited data
""		which indicated an injury but where no concrete evidence of injury
""		existed.
""		
""		-9 = Blank

IMPORTANT NOTE: Questions on features of a reporting location’s computerized capabilities have		
changed over the years. The instrument format used in 2016 is slightly different than what was used in		
2015 and previous years.		
""		
The current format is essentially similar to the recoded “R” variables used in 2010-2015.  For example, in		
2015, EDEMOG reflected the actual instrument format and EDEMOGR was a recoding of that format to		
match years 2010-2015 for trending purpose. The categories used with the recoded “R” variables were		
1=Yes, 2=No, and 4=Yes, but turned off/not used.  The ‘Turned off/not used’ category was dropped for		
2016, so the only response options are yes and no.  The “R” variable name was retained because the		
response categories are similar to those from 2010-2015 and they now reflect the actual instrument		
format as well. Please take note of these differences if using data from multiple years.

416 2	877-878	[SASDAPPT] Does your practice set time aside for same day
""		appointments?
""		
NOTE: There was a change for 2015 in how this question and the following question SDAPPTPCT were		
asked.  In previous years, the order of these questions was reversed and they were asked independently,		
meaning that a practice that reported a percentage of visits as same day appointments could also answer		
"“no” (did not set aside time for same day appointments). One might conjecture that the same day"		
appointments reported in such cases might have been due to last minute cancellations or other factors, as		
opposed to having specific time set aside for same day appointments.		
""		
For 2015, the survey instrument underwent a change, such that SASDAPPT was asked first, and ONLY		
physicians who responded “yes” to that question (does your practice set aside time for same day		
appointments?) were asked about the percentage of visits that were same day appointments.  For this		
reason the results from SDAPPTPCT will not be comparable with previous years of data, and, in fact,		
substantial differences can be seen when comparing percentages across years.  To further emphasize the		
differences, the item name has been changed from SDAPPT used in previous years to SDAPPTPCT in		
2015.

NOTE: Starting with the 2006 data release, all drug codes based on entry name (using NCHS’ standard	
classification system) were also assigned a unique generic drug code from Multum’s Lexicon Drug	
Database, where possible.  The structure of the Multum database is such that multiple ingredient drugs	
are assigned a single generic drug code encompassing all of a drug's ingredients rather than being	
assigned generic drug codes for each ingredient, as in past years of NAMCS drug data.  All Multum codes	
start with the letter “d” but there were some drugs reported in NAMCS that could not be assigned a code	
in Multum.  For 2006 and 2007, these received a prefix of either “a” (when ingredients could be	
determined) or “c” (when ingredients could not be determined).  Beginning with 2008, the use of “a” and	
"“c” codes was replaced with “n” codes. For more on the structure of the drug data (including information"	
on therapeutic class and drug ingredients), please see page 32.

""	NAMCS SAMPLE DESIGN VARIABLES
""	
NAMCS sampling design variables (in masked format) were first added to the 2000 public use file, and	
data years from 1993-1999 were re-released to include them.  These variables were for use with statistical	
software such as SUDAAN that takes into account the complex sampling design of the survey.  However,	
for those running versions of SAS, Stata, SPSS and other software that assumes a single stage of	
sampling, the multi-stage design variables provided on the public use files could not be used without	
modification. Therefore, in 2002, two new variables, CSTRATM and CPSUM, were developed, that could	
be used in such programs instead of the multi-stage variables.  In 2003, the decision was made to include	
on the public use file just these two variables and not the multi-stage design variables that appeared in the	
past.	
""	
Until such time as the older public use files may be re-released to include these variables, data users	
wishing to combine data from 2003 and later years with data from earlier years will find it necessary to	
create CSTRATM and CPSUM for the earlier files. A technical paper, Using Ultimate Cluster Models with	
NAMCS and NHAMCS Public Use Files, is available for downloading at the Ambulatory Health Care Data	
website: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/ahcd_questionnaires.htm. This paper gives instructions on how to	
configure data files prior to 2002 for variance estimation based on 1-stage sampling models, such as	
those used in SAS proc surveymeans, Stata, SPSS, and the SUDAAN with-replacement option, and how	
to handle instances of single-case strata in the data on the older files. Please also see the section on	
Relative Standard Errors in the current document for more information on these variables and how to use	
them. PSU is primary sampling unit.

In 2016, the NAMCS sampling design changed, as described in more detail on page 12.  For consistency	
with previous years, the same names used in earlier years have been used for the sample design	
variables.  For additional information on combining data across years with the old and new sample	
designs, please see p. 131.
